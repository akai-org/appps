## Why?
We had an idea that github READMEs are meant for more technical informations such us steps for building the project, configuration, setup etc. The main goal of this app is to provide platform for members of AKAI to showcase their projects more in depth. 

## Building project
1. Firstly setup [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io) package manager
2. Then execute commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/akai-org/apps.git
cd apps
pnpm install
```
3. If you want to run local dev server:
```
pnpm dev
```

## If you are AKAI member
